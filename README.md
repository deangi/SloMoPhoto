A application for an inexpensive ESP32 camera board (Aideepen ESP-CAM) that takes periodic photos and stores them on an SD card or uploads them to an FTP server.
Photos can be easily combined into a video to show progess on a very slowly changing situation like growing plants, movement of the moon, tracking some underwater phenomena, etc.
